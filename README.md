# KrewBot

KrewBot is a [krew.io](https://krew.io) themed Discord bot.

## Features

KrewBot currently mostly only has administration commands with a couple others added in, we are in the process of adding more Krew features such as the ability to view each servers leaderboard, the most profitable trade routes, and the prices of all in-game items at each island. This bot also features some cool things such as custom join and leave messages (which we are working on fixing some bugs for), and a custom help menu!
